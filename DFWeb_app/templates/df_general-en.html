<!--  HOW  -->
{% block how %}
  Deepfakes can create or alter person's voice or face and be almost unrecognisable from the real thing
{% endblock how %}

{% block how2 %}
  How does AI create things?
{% endblock how2 %}

{% block how3 %}
  <p class="text">Let's take </p>AI<p class="text"> that is tasked
    with generating an </p>image <p class="text">of a person</p>
{% endblock how3 %}

{% block how4 %}
  <p class="text">The AI is initially provided with </p>numerous images <p class="text">of people
  and is tasked with analyzing them during a </p>training<p class="text"> process</p>
{% endblock how4 %}

{% block how5 %}
  <p class="text">Afterwards, it is assigned a task to generate a </p>new image <p class="text">based
  on the</p> outcomes<p class="text"> of this training</p>
{% endblock how5 %}

{% block how6 %}
  <p class="text">When executed right the</p> AI creates<p class="text"> an image of a person that
  has</p> correct features <p class="text">such as head shape, nose, mouth etc.</p>
{% endblock how6 %}

{% block how7 %}
    Since the AI knows neither what a person is nor what nose or eyes should look like,
    it relies on the images we provided
{% endblock how7 %}

{% block how8 %}
  If we provide only images of man with blonde hair, well we will get an image of a
  man with blonde hair back
{% endblock how8 %}

{% block how9 %}
  This may or may not be the desired behaviour, that depends on what we want to achieve
{% endblock how9 %}

{% block how10 %}
  This process is the same for audio and video as well, it just needs an appropriate input
{% endblock how10 %}


<!--  WHY  -->
{% block why %}
    Why do deepfakes seem so real?
{% endblock why %}

{% block why2 %}
  <p class="text">They use </p><h5>G</h5><p class="text">enerative
  </p><h5>A</h5><p class="text">dvesarial </p><h5>N</h5><p class="text">etwork
  (</p>GAN<p class="text">) to achieve this</p>
{% endblock why2 %}

{% block why3 %}
  <p class="text">GAN is composed of </p>2 AI<p class="text">s</p>
{% endblock why3 %}

{% block why4 %}
  <p class="text">1st AI called</p> generator <p class="text">tries to generate
  the best possible deepfake</p>
{% endblock why4 %}

{% block why5 %}
  <p class="text">2nd AI called</p> discriminator<p class="text"> can receive either a
  </p>deepfake<p class="text"> made by the generator or a</p> real image<p class="text">, and
  it has to correctly determine if it is a deepfake or not</p>
{% endblock why5 %}

{% block why6 %}
  Once the generator can produce deepfakes that can fool the discriminator reliably, they
  can be used to fool humans as well as machines
