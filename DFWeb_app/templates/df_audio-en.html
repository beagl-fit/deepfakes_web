{% block how2 %}
    Instead of pictures, the AI is given audio recordings of a specific person for training

{% block how3 %}
    Once the training is completed, the AI is able to produce speech that

<!--    TTS & STS     -->
{% block tts %}
    Text-to-speech synthesis
{% endblock tts %}

{% block tts2 %}
    Text-to-speech or TTS is a way to generate speech from a written text
{% endblock tts2 %}

{% block sts %}
    Speech-to-speech conversion
{% endblock sts %}

{% block sts2 %}
    Speech-to-speech or STS is a way to make one person sound as another
{% endblock sts2 %}


<!--    TTS WHY     -->
{% block ttswhy %}
    Why use TTS{% endblock ttswhy %}

{% block ttswhy2 %}
    TTS adds accessibility to any text for people with visual impairments or other disabilities.
{% endblock ttswhy2 %}

{% block ttswhy3 %}
    Easy and fast way to create long recordings, such as audiobooks.
{% endblock ttswhy3 %}

{% block ttswhy4 %}
    TTS is the way digital assistants such as Siri or Alexa communicate with you.
{% endblock ttswhy4 %}

{% block ttswhy5 %}
    Convenient way for streamers, youtubers etc. to not have to read messages such as donation messages.
{% endblock ttswhy5 %}

{% block ttswhy6 %}
    For fun - it is a way to "make others" say silly things.
{% endblock ttswhy6 %}


<!--    STS WHY     -->
{% block stswhy %}
    Why use STS{% endblock stswhy %}

{% block stswhy2 %}
    Dubbing of movies, adds etc. can be done anyone and not change how the actors and actresses sound.
{% endblock stswhy2 %}

{% block stswhy3 %}
    STS can be found in online games and voice parodies.
{% endblock stswhy3 %}

{% block stswhy4 %}
    Creation of "AI covers" uses STS to make songs sound like they were sung by other artists.
{% endblock stswhy4 %}

{% block stswhy5 %}
    The main advantage of STS over TTS is the possibility to produce deepfakes in real-time, this means that the voice
    is converted as the person is speaking.
{% endblock stswhy5 %}


<!--   WHAT     -->
{% block what %}
    What to look out for{% endblock what %}

{% block what2 %}
    Since the deepfake may sound identical to a person you know it can be easy to exploit this
{% endblock what2 %}

{% block vish3 %}
    an attack where the voice is used to gain victims trust and the aim can be fraud or stealing sensitive information
{% endblock vish3 %}

{% block vish4 %}
    Imagine getting a call from someone that sounds like your boss/subordinate asking you for a password your company
    uses or a door code
{% endblock vish4 %}

{% block vish5 %}
    Or your family member in distress asking you for some money
{% endblock vish5 %}

{% block scam1 %}
    an attack where the aim is to defraud you of your money
{% endblock scam1 %}

{% block scam2 %}
    often seen in form of adds, but could be even phone calls, podcasts...
{% endblock scam2 %}

{% block scam3 %}
    a well-known person (and someone you trust) tells you to buy or to invest in something
{% endblock scam3 %}

{% block scam4 %}
    only for you to see neither the money nor product/service you paid for
{% endblock scam4 %}

{% block bio1 %}
    Biometrics
{% endblock bio1 %}

{% block bio2 %}
    an attacker committing identity theft and using your voice can lead to these systems being unable to distinguish
    between you and them
{% endblock bio2 %}

{% block bio3 %}
    things like smart locks with voice activation or telephone transactions, where voice is used to confirm ones
    identity are at risk
{% endblock bio3 %}

{% block what3 %}
    <p class="text">Using voice deepfakes is also easy way to spread</p> disinformation<p class="text">, because
    an attacker can make anyone say things they never said and would never say</p>
{% endblock what3 %}

{% block what4 %}
    misleading information, propaganda or racist remarks can be used to hurt anyone in the eyes of others or to support
    ones own agenda

    How can TTS do harm in practice{% endblock ttsscen %}


{% block ttsscen1 %}
    Scenario
{% endblock ttsscen1 %}

{% block ttsscen11 %}
    A tech-savvy scammer plans to defraud individuals by impersonating a well-known actor in a commercial.
{% endblock ttsscen11 %}

{% block ttsscen12 %}
    The scammer utilizes deepfake technology to convincingly replicate the actor's voice and crafts a script for the
    scam.
{% endblock ttsscen12 %}

{% block ttsscen13 %}
    Creating a fake investment opportunity, the scammer employs a text-to-speech algorithm to narrate the script in the
    actor's voice.
{% endblock ttsscen13 %}

{% block ttsscen14 %}
    The narration promotes a fraudulent investment scheme, leveraging the actor's credibility to gain trust.
{% endblock ttsscen14 %}

{% block ttsscen15 %}
    The scammer disseminates the audio message through various channels, including YouTube ads, social media, and
    messaging platforms.
{% endblock ttsscen15 %}

{% block ttsscen16 %}
    Unsuspecting victims, deceived by the convincing voice, fall prey to the scam, investing money in the fraudulent
    scheme.
{% endblock ttsscen16 %}


{% block ttsscen2 %}
    scenario
{% endblock ttsscen2 %}

{% block ttsscen21 %}
    A notorious fake news outlet aims to spread disinformation about a specific politician.
{% endblock ttsscen21 %}

{% block ttsscen22 %}
    The outlet downloads a video of the politician's speech and replicates their voice using deepfake technology.
{% endblock ttsscen22 %}

{% block ttsscen23 %}
    Crafting a script portraying the politician in a manner contrary to their beliefs, the outlet employs text-to-speech
    deepfake technology for narration.
{% endblock ttsscen23 %}

{% block ttsscen24 %}
    The outlet replaces the original audio in the video with the deepfake voice.
{% endblock ttsscen24 %}

{% block ttsscen25 %}
    The fabricated news story is published, supported by the deepfake, and outraged readers share the misinformation
    on social media.
{% endblock ttsscen25 %}

{% block ttsscen26 %}
    Other fake news outlets amplify the narrative, further damaging the politician's reputation and enhancing the fake
    story's credibility.

    How can STS do harm in practice{% endblock stsscen %}


{% block stsscen1 %}
    Scenario
{% endblock stsscen1 %}

{% block stsscen11 %}
    A hacker, aiming to access a company's system, opts for voice conversion over traditional hacking methods.
{% endblock stsscen11 %}

{% block stsscen12 %}
    After identifying an employee with sufficient clearance, the hacker gathers information from the corporate website
    and social networks, including the target's habits.
{% endblock stsscen12 %}

{% block stsscen13 %}
    Discovering the target frequents a caf√©, the hacker records the employee's speech covertly during conversations.
{% endblock stsscen13 %}

{% block stsscen14 %}
    Using segments of the recorded audio, the hacker analyzes and replicates the target's speech through voice
    conversion.
{% endblock stsscen14 %}

{% block stsscen15 %}
    Posing as the employee, the hacker calls the company's IT department, leveraging the replicated voice to request a
    forgotten password.
{% endblock stsscen15 %}

{% block stsscen16 %}
    The small size of the company allows the hacker's ruse to succeed, as the IT specialist immediately provides the
    supposed coworker with the forgotten password, granting unauthorized access.
{% endblock stsscen16 %}


{% block stsscen2 %}
    scenario
{% endblock stsscen2 %}

{% block stsscen21 %}
    A crafty thief, driven by a desire for financial gain, targets a wealthy family by exploiting their familial
    concern.

{% block stsscen22 %}
    The thief thoroughly researches the target's social media, discovering that the parents are currently on vacation
    through images and videos.
{% endblock stsscen22 %}

{% block stsscen23 %}
    Utilizing the mother's voice heard in videos, the thief creates a deepfake and employs voice conversion technology
    to mimic her voice convincingly.
{% endblock stsscen23 %}

{% block stsscen24 %}
    Seizing a strategic moment, the thief places a call to the target, impersonating the distressed mother in need
    during the vacation.
{% endblock stsscen24 %}

{% block stsscen25 %}
    Employing voice conversion technology to mimic the mother's voice, the thief fabricates an emergency, urgently
    requesting financial assistance.

{% block stsscen26 %}
    Capitalizing on the emotional distress and urgency, the thief successfully convinces the target to wire them money,
    completing the deceptive scheme.

    The fraudster is able to extract voice samples from speech a manager of his target company gave and which was

    Using AI STS technology he is able to make himself sound like said manager during a phone-call he makes to an
